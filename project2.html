            <h2>Project 2: PLANNING, ANALYSIS AND DESIGN OF A COMMERCIAL BUILDING</h2>
            <p><strong>Project Description:</strong>This commercial building having mixed stories with shopping complex and office 
                space, Shopping is a routine activity of each and every one. But they due to shortage of 
                time, they need a shopping complex and office space under one roof to save the valuable 
                time. In metropolitan cities, very limited areas are available and sold at high cost. This project will help to build buildings within this limited area satisfying each of every need 
                of the people. It is also designed in such a way that it would be economical.
                This project work involves planning, analysis, designs, and drawings of a typical multistoried building. This project attempt has been made to plan, design and estimate a G+5 
                storied commercial building. This project involves Planning, Analysis, and Design & 
                Drawings. In Analysis various load cases and load combinations are included in this 
                project. R.C.C framed structure is used for multi storied commercial buildings. 
                Structural design is to be done using Limit state method.
                Structural engineers are facing the challenges of striving for most efficient and 
                economical design with accuracy in solution while ensuring that the final design of a 
                building and the building must be serviceable for its intended function over its design 
                life time. The main objective of the project is to modify the general design practice of a 
                multi storied building. The structural design should satisfy the criterion of ultimate 
                strength and serviceability. A civil engineer must be familiar with planning, analysis and 
                design of framed structures. Hence it was proposed to choose a problem, involving 
                analysis and design of multi storied framed structure as the project work.
                The proposed five storied commercial building consists of area of each floor is 1900sqm. 
                A building should be planned to make it comfortable, economical and to meet all the 
                requirements of the people. The efforts of the planner should be to obtain maximum 
                comfort with limited available resources. Functional, utility, cost, habits, taste, 
                requirements etc., should also be considered in planning a building. The planning of this 
                five storied building is so planned to meet out all the above factors.</p>
